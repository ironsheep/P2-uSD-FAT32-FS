# Method Ordering Guide — dual_sd_fat32_flash_fs.spin2

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Applies to:** `dual_sd_fat32_flash_fs.spin2` (unified dual-FS driver)
**Portable:** This guide can be carried to agents working on any Spin2 driver following the same conventions.

---

## Rationale

The driver has 300+ methods spanning two devices (SD and Flash), multiple conditional compilation blocks, and a mix of PUB API surface and PRI implementation. A canonical ordering makes the file readable top-to-bottom as a narrative:

1. **PUB before PRI** — A reader sees the full public API before any implementation details.
2. **Lifecycle first** — Mount/unmount/init before any file operations.
3. **Common operations early** — File I/O and directory operations before metadata and legacy.
4. **Conditional features last** — `#IFDEF`-gated PUB sections after core API.
5. **PRI sections mirror PUB flow** — Worker infrastructure, then handle management, then device-specific operations, ending with the lowest-level SPI layer.

## What Does NOT Move

These regions are anchored at fixed positions in the file and are never reordered:

| Region | Position | Contents |
|--------|----------|----------|
| File header | Lines 1-21 | `{{ }}` doc block with file description |
| `#PRAGMA` / `#IFDEF` preamble | After header | Conditional compilation setup |
| `CON` blocks | After preamble | All constant declarations |
| `STRUCT` blocks | After CON | Structure type definitions |
| `DAT` preamble | After STRUCT | Singleton state, parameter blocks, handle tables, buffers |
| `OBJ` block | Where needed | Object references (if any) |
| LICENSE block | End of file | `CON` + `{{ }}` license text — always last |

Only `PUB` and `PRI` method blocks are reordered.

---

## PUB Sections (1-11)

Methods are listed within each section in the order they should appear. Section dividers use `CON` outline labels for VS Code navigation.

### Section 1: LIFECYCLE

Core driver lifecycle — initialization, teardown, mounting, status queries.

```
null, init, stop, mount, unmount, mounted, canMount, version, format
```

### Section 2: FILE I/O

Opening, reading, writing, seeking, syncing, and closing files.

```
open, open_circular, create_file, close, flush
openFileRead, openFileWrite, createFileNew, closeFileHandle
readHandle, writeHandle
seekHandle, seek, flashSeek, tellHandle, eofHandle, fileSizeHandle
syncHandle, syncAllHandles, copyFile
```

### Section 3: DIRECTORY

Directory navigation and enumeration.

```
openDirectory, readDirectoryHandle, closeDirectoryHandle
readDirectory (legacy), newDirectory, changeDirectory, directory
```

### Section 4: METADATA

File metadata queries and modifications.

```
exists, file_size, file_size_unused, rename, deleteFile, moveFile
freeSpace, stats, setDate, serial_number, TEST_count_file_bytes
```

### Section 5: BYTE/WORD/LONG/STRING I/O

Typed read/write helpers built on top of readHandle/writeHandle.

```
wr_byte, rd_byte, wr_word, rd_word, wr_long, rd_long, wr_str, rd_str
```

### Section 6: LEGACY

Older API methods retained for backward compatibility. These operate on the "current" file/directory state rather than explicit handles.

```
fileName, fileSize, attributes, volumeLabel, setVolumeLabel, syncDirCache
```

### Section 7: ERROR/DIAGNOSTIC

Error reporting and stack guard checking. The `DAT` block containing `error_strings` moves with `string_for_error` into this section.

```
error, string_for_error (+ DAT error_strings), checkStackGuard
```

### Section 8: #IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_RAW

Raw sector access methods — gated behind `SD_INCLUDE_RAW`.

```
#IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_RAW
readSectorRaw, writeSectorRaw, readSectorsRaw, writeSectorsRaw, readVBRRaw
#ENDIF
```

### Section 9: #IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_REGISTERS

Card register access methods — gated behind `SD_INCLUDE_REGISTERS`.

```
#IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_REGISTERS
readCIDRaw, readCSDRaw, readSCRRaw, readSDStatusRaw, getOCR
#ENDIF
```

### Section 10: #IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_SPEED

High-speed mode control — gated behind `SD_INCLUDE_SPEED`. Note: ungated speed getters (getSPIFrequency, getCardMaxSpeed, etc.) appear outside the `#IFDEF` block, immediately after it.

```
#IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_SPEED
attemptHighSpeed, setSPISpeed, checkCMD6Support, checkHighSpeedCapability
#ENDIF

' Ungated speed/register getters (always available)
getSPIFrequency, getCardMaxSpeed, getManufacturerID, getReadTimeout, getWriteTimeout, isHighSpeedActive
```

### Section 11: #IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_DEBUG

Debug and diagnostic methods — gated behind `SD_INCLUDE_DEBUG`.

```
#IFDEF SD_INCLUDE_DEBUG
getWriteDiag, getLastCMD13, getLastCMD13Error
getLastReceivedCRC, getLastCalculatedCRC, getLastSentCRC
getCRCMatchCount, getCRCMismatchCount, getCRCRetryCount
setCRCValidation, setTestForceReadError, setTestForceWriteError
getTestErrorCount, clearTestErrors
debugGetRootSec, debugGetDirSec, debugGetVbrSec, debugGetFatSec, debugGetSecPerFat

## #IFDEF Block Rules

1. **Each `#IFDEF` block keeps its PUBs and PRIs together** within matching `#IFDEF`/`#ENDIF` guards. A PUB section and its associated PRI section may be in separate `#IFDEF` blocks (e.g., PUB Section 8 and the `do_read_scr`/`do_read_cid` PRIs in Section D).

2. **`fs_worker` has internal `#IFDEF` case blocks** — these dispatch entries do NOT move. The worker's case statement references forward-declared methods, which is fine in Spin2.

3. **Ungated methods must NOT accidentally land inside a conditional block.** Methods like `readCSD`, `readCID`, `identifyCard`, `setOptimalSpeed`, `getSPIFrequency`, `getCardMaxSpeed` etc. that are called from both gated and ungated code must remain outside `#IFDEF` guards, OR must be inside the correct guard that is always active when they are called.

4. **When in doubt, check callers.** If a method is called from ungated code, it must itself be ungated. If it is only called from within one `#IFDEF` block, it belongs in that block.

---

## Section Dividers

Each section boundary uses a `CON` outline label for VS Code navigation:

```spin2
CON ' ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    ' SECTION NAME
    ' ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

The first `CON` line appears in the VS Code Outline panel. The indented lines provide context when reading the source.

---

## Applying to Other Drivers

This ordering scheme adapts to any Spin2 driver:

1. Replace device-specific section names (Flash/SD) with the driver's subsystems.
2. Keep the PUB-before-PRI rule and the lifecycle-first ordering.
3. Keep `#IFDEF` blocks self-contained with their PUBs and PRIs.
4. Keep the lowest-level hardware layer (SPI, I2C, etc.) as the last PRI section.
